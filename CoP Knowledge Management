# Research Guide Templates page
- Might be helpful to have a description for each resource (e.g., why we use VA template; when and how to use user incentives justification memo)
- duplication of "Interview Guide Template" Header
- Consent form template doesn't seem to exist

# How-to Tasks
- Love the concept of this section, just needs to be fleshed out!

# Participant Recruitment Rolodex
- A little confused by this section. I thought the names where the names of participants; didn't realize they were the USDSers who conducted the research! 
  - Will this be useful as these USDSers roll off?
- Links to contact info or project repository would be useful
