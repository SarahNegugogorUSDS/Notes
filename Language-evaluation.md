- Native speakers don't usually take any tests to get certified
- Even native speakers have to be aware of dialect differences and cultural nuances
- Bilingual skills are useful when working with stakeholders also
- When applying to USDS you don't know what you're applying to - very general; both were surprised that bilingual skills were helpful
- Probably need to put this question in application process (Which languages do you speak?)
  - Ask their proficiency level
  - Ask during interview process if they want to do language assessment
- Want to be strategic about when we ask Glori and Charlie to do interviews
- They feel confident in their ability to evaluate Spanish speakers
- Perhaps ask applicants to submit written sample (from previous work)
  - If they select Spanish, perhaps ask them to write their blurb about why they want to join USDS in Spanish
- Need to have intermediate skills at least; Glori feels they need to be fluent, especially with stakeholders
  - Can be difficult situations, talking about sensitive things
  - Intermediate can be good for assisting fluent speakers (taking notes)
- Have language assessment be a separate part of the interview structure, not assessing subject-matter skills
- Be clear that language skills are added value; still need to meet basic requirements
- When bilingual skills are salient, divisions between COPs become less important
- Should we set a goal of how many people we need to bring in?
- Look at data to identify need - how many projects have needed bilingual skills?
